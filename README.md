#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project allowed users to calculate how much interest they would make based on the interest rate they input. It calculated both with monthly deposits and without. It helped make financial planning easier on the user. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I did well in making the code readable while also using comments to let other programmers understand what different lines of code would do. I also believe I had good naming conventions that are simple enough to infer, but I also commented what each variable does. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I used more than one files, the code could have been even easier to read. For example, if I had one file that was reserved for functions that the main used, it would be easier for other programmers to make changes as needed. Plus, if I were to add to the code, a single file would be harder to navigate. Multiple files would keep everything more organized. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part of the code was figuring out what math equations I needed to use where. I had to figure out where the interest would be added and where the deposits would be added. To solve this, I wrote out the order in pseduocode first. Having that to look through while I coded helped me stay on track. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most tranferrable skills I got from this project are outlining the code beforehand and making use of whitespace and comments. Both of these are valuable skill to have for any programmer using any language and getting a good grasp on those in this program will go a long way with future projects. Outlining makes the process of writing code easier and less daunting. Whitespace helps with readability and comments are useful when other people want to edit my code. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Utilizing comments for each section of code helps with maintainability so anyone with knowledge of C++ can edit it as needed. Using whitespace properly helped improve readability. For example, using the same amount of spaces for each line within a loop or function for others to understand what lines are grouped together. Having simplified code helped with adaptability so if anyone wanted to edit a part of it, those changes would require minimal effort.
